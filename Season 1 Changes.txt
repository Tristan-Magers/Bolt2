1.0.9

Rank
- Negative winstreaks deduct less rank (20 -> 15 each)
- System to limit rank inflation is relaxed more to allow higher rank growth (only 1-3 more or less a game)
- Ranked ties scramble winstreaks to allow different teams next round
- Note: working on balancing between rank creating balanced teams and diverse teams while being a "feel-good" experience

Items
- Armor resets flag capture timer to 0.5s when hit on point capture mode (if over 0.5s captured)
- Traps has 1 tick delay before making hiss sound when in range

Bug Fixes
- Improved spawn point owner detection
- Generator text displayed on coves during non CtF
- Flag drop sound wound be delayed

Known issues
- Placeables can give wrong owner in rare cases. Working on a perfect solution
- Walls can lift objects on nearby walls is weird cases
- Pushing players in lobby is a issue in high player count lobbies. Considering removing player push entirely in lobby.

1.0.10

Version
- Updated to Minecraft version 1.21.5

Lobby
- Tournament hall grand opening

Flag
- Every time a flag is dropped the time to despawn is 0.25s faster down to (2s) [Note: starts at 4s]
    - Resets when returned
- Flag has 0.1 smaller grab radius (1.8 -> 1.7)
- Grabbing the flag removes any invulnerability

Rank
- Half loses/wins cause only 70% rank change

Maps
- Tiny Town door opens 0.2s faster (1s -> 0.8s)
- Raised Valley ceiling by 2 in the center and the build height by 1
- Garden build height raised by 1

Bug Fixes
- Shifting while respawning to spawnpoint on a slab could phase you through the slab
- Placables could sometimes be credited to the wrong person
    - Still possible in rare cases but now vastly less common
    - Still working on that perfect solution
- You can place items in the back of Garden spawn
- Patched Garden location where you could place spawn points out of map

1.0.11

Version
- Updated to Minecraft version 1.21.7

Items
- Reworked how crossbows are triggered after 1.21.3 changes prevented delaying activation

1.0.12

General
- Improved arrow hitboxes
    - Arrows can no longer hit creepers through blocks they are standing on
    - Arrows are more consistant at hitting creepers
    - Arrows are more consistant at hitting minions
    - Note: these changes mostly undo the changes Mineccraft made by making arrow hitboxes dynamic at the start of shot

Settings
- Removed "Infected Priority" Settings
    - This setting was rarely used and was seen as extremely confusing and unnessisary
    - May come back in a better form
- Added "CtF One Player Flag Armor" setting
    - Enables/disables if armor is given on flag return when facing only one player (including 1v1)
    - Disabled by default
    - Note: armor seems to be a frustrating mechanic in 1v1 and 1v2, and we want to make it an option to avoid

Infection
- "Jump" evolution now gives 10% speed buff (stacks with speed)
